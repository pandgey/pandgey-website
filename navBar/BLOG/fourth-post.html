      <p style="font-size: 25px;">Ciao! hiiiii, yes hiii. how are you doing? im doing alright here and i hope you are doing well and enjoying your life too! my life has been going up and down and up and down and up and up then down and down and down then for some reason up. basically, a roller coaster yes!</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">so what have i been doing? im currently upgrading this website right now because i feel that the old one lacks human soul and not much stuff to express myself, so yea i upgraded this. hope you like it! i design this website based on 5 colors. black, white, and all the colors on the bisexual flag. idk, the ideas was just there and the next thing i realized im already working on this website. so i thank you for taking your time to visit this website.</p> 
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">im not only worked on that but also improving the "mini" defender to protect my mini homelab/server from intruder. its not much, i just converted it to C because i want to improve efficiency and leave some room for me to upgrade by adding ESP32 board with some arduino board too. i will work on that as well</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">i also move to a new place, which is closer to my university now. this means that im gonna have to walk there for less than 30 mins! lightwork. i have also been going around and try new stuff as well, pretty cool. i was about to go fishing the other day but aarrrgghhhh the wind is just too strong.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">last but not least, i have been working and cooking up on this project with a few folks i met online to create a game. its still a work in progress, but im currently working on a junkyard assets. which has been nothing but a blast. i just enjoy it, cant wait to see the final result. and cant wait for YOU to try it as well! so stay tune for that!</p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">"Hey you also mentioned stress? What stress?"welp its about job and employment. I think its more like a little anxiety and stress about future because i actually enjoy doing this IT thing but at the same time im not sure if people can see my passion or not. i would someone would notice that at least, but yea im just holding on to my passion and lets see where it takes me. thanks for checking me out! you are the best</p>
