      <p style="font-size: 25px;">hi!, it has been awhile. i have been pretty much busy with so many stuff with my life right now. i have to prepare to move to my new place, work on my side projects, and work on my art. these stuffs may not sound a lot, it actually is not a lot (except moving to my new place).</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">So, what have i been working on? well after i finished my exam, i pretty much use those remaining time of june to actually work on color-picker. You can check it like by clicking this link right <a href="https://github.com/pandgey/Color-Picker">here</a>. its an algorithm that basically help user pick their color harmony for them to use. simple, yes. and i planned to upgrade this algorithm by adding ai suggested color palette so stay tune for that!</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">another project that i worked on is what i called a "dicerator" or a dice generator. i always carry my boardgame around, a digital copy of it. and obviously i always carry my rpg dices around as well. when i say carry around, i literally mean carry them to everywhere i go with me (even to my class!). so thats the reason i decided to develop <a href="https://github.com/pandgey/Dicerator">this</a>. go check it out! and feel free to lemme know what i should add more to that.</p> 
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">"wow! you worked on so many things! you work so hard! what a nerd" hey! i heard that! i dont only worked on those stuff you know! i work and learn a lot for my Project AGLS too, which is coming soon ;] (its a game project and im a 3D artist in there, its a first person shooting. think of madmax but with scifi and zombie!) </p>

      <p style="font-size: 25px;">Things I did today:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Write this blog</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Practice more bass</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Continue working on another project(oooooo, stay tune for that!)</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Chillax</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="font-size: 25px;">i truly grateful that you managed to read this far!</p>
