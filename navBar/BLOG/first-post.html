      <p style="font-size: 25px;">Hiya! This is my first ever blog post! I just set this up and it's working... somehow :D</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">The reason I started this is because of that one evening that I ran into something cool. While traversing through blocks of code and tons of information, I ran into a group of people that still do webring like those back in the early 2000s. And I was like "Wait a minute, thats so cool and sick and really really cool and awesome! Yk what? Lets try that as well!". And here we are. As usual, im still wondering what my younger self would say or tell me if they ran into this website. Cant wait to show that little guy. And guess what? That little guy seems be into sci-fi movie and space alien and planet and galaxy and stuff. But what does he like the most? Robot! yea imma try to make my own AI after upgrading this homelab thing of mine. As usual, just to impress that lil guy.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 25px;">Things I did today:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Set up the blog folder</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Linked everything back to the main site</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Tested responsiveness</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="font-size: 25px;">More to come soon!</p>
