      <p style="font-size: 25px;">hai hai there! tt has been idk how long since I write a blog but here goes!</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">hi! how are you? i hope you are doing well. whatever life throws at you, im sure ur gonna ace it and nail it! how am i doing? welp its mid-sem break rn and i have been going around looking for internship and stuff. the economy is kinda cooked, but im sure i will somehow find a place for myself to work on. at least some</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">also!!!! *drum roll*i have been upgrading my "mini server" too! guess what? i made a kubernetes out of my raspberry pi. 2 pi 5 and 1 pi 4! can you believe it! i thought i wouldnt be able to pull this off</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">if you are wondering what im using this server as, i use it primarily as my nas, streaming service (yes i built my own long time ago but never expand it), and last but not least my encyclopedia. im still working on it, its a surprise but i will update y'all more about it for sure!</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">"you mentioned its your mid-sem break, what is your plan during holiday?" idk, prob camping, touch grass, embrace nature, work on my side projects, workin on my student team stuff and upgrade my server? prob and most likely just those yes, oh and maybe learn sth new for tech and my future project</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">also, i just started learning deep learning. idk, so much talk of ai these days. ai this, ai that. i just know that each user input has somewhat "activation" range thing. its pretty cool ngl! and then there are different activation algorithm and math and stuff (im suck at math). but yea, oh and another thing. very important, i have plan to upgrade my laptop to dualboot with linux. cuz why not, i prefer linux pretty much these days.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 25px;">Things I did today:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Write this blog</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Chilling (i have to, im workaholic)</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Work on some cool project</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Chilling (thats x2)</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="font-size: 25px;">as always, spread love! and take care of yourself</p>
