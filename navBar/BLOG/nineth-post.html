      <p style="font-size: 25px;">hey hey hey, halloween was HERE!!!! happy halloween y'all!!! do enjoy yourself and spend time with your love ones please. also, enjoy yourself as much as yourself</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">as for me, i have SO much to discuss. first up, i got promoted to become an IT director of radio monash in 2026. not sure how either. here is how it happened: a dude mentioned one of radio's pc is broken -> the other guy said he is too busy with assignment -> i volunteer to come in diagnose the pc -> turns out the motherboard chipped is kapooosh -> they invited me to be the next IT director. moral of the story: be present and let that passion shine. yes, idk how but thats just how.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">next up, ummmmmm where do i begin. im starting to understand myself more, in terms of sexual orientation and gender orientation and stuff idk its like further and further and keep upgrading and understanding myself. its very rewarding since ik what i like and dont like. idk, this just occurs to me when i skip my meds for like a day or two and things get clearer. :P</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">Ooooo this, i really wanna share this. essentially, i made a rag algo. yes thats right. i managed to pull this out thanks to my friend name tham. everybody, say 'thank you, tham'. yes he help me and point me some direction to help me create this lil rag, i will further enhance it tho ofc. i havent fine-tuned it yet but soon.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">'halloween halloween, what did you do during that time?' welp, i wear some skirt and experiment with myself. not like cutting, injecting or anything tho :> its just me trying new outfit style, and yea stay at home and chill a lil bit. idk i like it that way. its fun, how was your halloween? i hope you had a good time! if not then im so sorry but it will get better.</p>
