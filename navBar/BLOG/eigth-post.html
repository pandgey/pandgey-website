      <p style="font-size: 25px;">hi hi hi everyone!!! it has been idk howlong since i write a blog but oh well, so much has pass and i have done so so so many things these past few weeks! oh and also, i hope you are doing really really well. now back to me:</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">obviously, if u come to this website you would notice it has that pumpkin "skin" color from my ordinary color. i changed it because halloween is coming and so its time to upgrade the look of my website to sth else, cuz why not! i also upgraded my oc to have that "vampire" look. i tried aight? they have that look because i like vampire. if i would reborn again, being vampire aint that bad to me. i love that gothic vibe anyway.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">next up, i upgraded my laptop! again? new laptop? NO!, i dual-boot endeavourOS with windows. i realized that using windows has been nothing but a pain to me, being tracked and keep seeing ads and stuff. "well you could delete windows yk, why not?" yeah why not, i question myself too but its because of my university bs alright? most of the software in uni still uses windows, i hope they change that soon because its so troublesome.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">welp since i upgraded my laptop, my lil pi clusters have also been upgraded too! it has been promoted from pi-cluster to kubernetes! (not sure if thats the right term, feel free to correct me ._.). but yes, it has been upgraded. i created a nas that connects to my laptop and my phone. meaning i can stream music and transfer file seamlessly now, does that sound familiar to any apple user? yea, suck it up cuz i can do that now too. it does not works like theirs, but at least its sth aight? cool</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">what makes your kubernetes so special then? yare yare, glad that you asked. its a nas, an encyclopedia that i have spent over hours scouring through internet and looking for those info, and soon to be.....lets not say it or else i wont make. the last one is a secret :P cant tell or else it wont happen, stay tune for that.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">what about work?j*b? aaaaaaahhhhh, im trying to find internship here aight? still searching for it but it seems no one wants to give me a chance to do their work. if u stick with me long enough, you know that i like to do stuff if its interests me and stuff which obviously i wanna work. gain more knowledge, and expand my technological frontier. oooohhhh that sounds cool wth.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 25px;">Things I did today:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Write this blog</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Config my endeavourOS to improve my "productivity"</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Work on some cool project</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Chilling but harder</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="font-size: 25px;">i like to always end things with a positive message, stay cool, stay safe, stay hydrate, and ofc keep grinding what interest ya! YOU WILL GET THERE ONE DAY! TRUST!</p>
