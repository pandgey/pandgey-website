      <p style="font-size: 30px;"><strong>Date:</strong> August 4, 2025</p>

      <p style="font-size: 25px;">yo everyone! its pandgey! im back, sorry for not updating much. it has been a busy days, weeks, and month these last few days. so here are some updates!</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">BUT. before i start anything, i would like to thank all those 1000s viewers who have visited my website. i thank you! i never thought so many people will actually visited my website but when i saw that number, i was like "holy craapp! i never expect it to be that much!" but yea, i thank you tho for checking me out! if you are here, i thank you too!</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">next up, i have been to this cool places called Balarat and Bendigo in australia victoria. it has been a blast, me and my brother never planned for any of those at all. while he drives, i search up for a new place. i like it this way, unplanned is better than a planned trip. I GET TO TOUCH KANGAROO TOO! although i kinda feel guilty for them tho, its like they are not in the wild to explore but instead in a caged place called zoo.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">i have also gotten a new laptop. i want to express my deepest gratitude to my family, truly. i planned to use this laptop for the next prob like 6-7 years. as long as possible.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">last but not least, this one is the least expected thing ever. its like i keep thinking about her on my mind, im not sure why but its hard to get this out of my head. SO, here is the story. while i went to check out a new laptop with my brother, there is this person (i dont want to specify their gender) help me choose my laptop and check it out for me. SHE WAS SO NICE, ik she is a staff there and its part of her job to provide service. But like, i can feel it that she is nice and caring and stuff. YES! i fell for her and i told my brother and my other friend about this. my brother was like if you like her, go back to the store and talk to her. IM LIKE GGGAARRGGHHHH IDKKKKKK. oh yea, i know its she/her pronoun because i asked her (yk, just in case). BUT LIKE SHE IS SOOO NICE AND CUTE AND SO KINDDDDDD.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">as of now, i discovered new things about me everyday. and i like it, and i wish you to keep discovering yourself too!</p>
