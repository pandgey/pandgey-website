      <p style="font-size: 25px;">hey! hi! hi1 how are ya doing? it has not been many days ik, but man so many stuff have happened within a short span of a week. lets start with the negative to positive first aight?</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">so negative part, ummmmm my hometown is flooded. yep, bad like real bad. cant describe it at all but all im saying is its really really bad. my parents cried when they heard my voice, they're kinda shocked which is understandable. i do feel bad for them now for studying overseas, but yk? im doing my really best here, love ya mom n dad if ur reading this!</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">next up, im losing some my friends. not in a bad way, like they all going back to their countries which is kinda sucks because they're actually the nicest lad i have ever and ever known. sending all the love to ben, naeem, and wali. ben: ur the best, can be a lil bit of a prick and annoying at a time but i respect. ur doing it for my own good and care, which i respect and truly appreciate that. naeem and wali: man, u introduce me to a new world of music. u help me achieve my goal this year which is explore the world of music and for that i truly appreciate it. keep shining and makin music wali cuz i wanna see that from ya. love <3</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">also, i went thrifting earlier this week and guess what? i hit the jackpot, i got a travis scott merch. i looked it up and its the collab between cactus jack and aj. holy, it looks so so so so good and dun even mentioned about the resell price. it could go up to 300 dollars like come on dude! thats the best deal evar!.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">last but not least, i bought some stuff to "gothified" myself. im not sure how i did it too. but yk wat? i love wat im doing, its a bit wasteful but at the same time i kinda like myself more! like im trying to achieve sth my body cant actually do it. overall, i love it and satisfied wit it.</p>
      <p style="font-size: 25px;">also, again im writing this whole thing 35000 ft from earth :D </p>

      <p style="font-size: 25px;">Things I did today:</p>
      <ul>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Flying back to my hometown</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">Writing this blog over 35000 feet cuz why not?</li>
        <li style="font-size: 25px;">I cant fall asleep at the same time too, prob cuz of the stress and my creativity but i will try to get some sleep when i feel sleepy or sum</li>
