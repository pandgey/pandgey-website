    <h1>Exam just finished, and oh boy</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 17, 2025</p>

      <p>My exam just finished and oh boy, as usual i didnt complete it and now im feeling kinda crap right now like real bad.</p>
      <p>But you know what? Exam is finished and one thing to worry about is no more. now i can focus on this website, my other side projects and game and more and so on. i can keep talking and yap as much as possible but nah, imma keep it short and simple. i will continue to work on my project. specifically, made this website to the best i can be which i know there is no way since my javascript is very scrappy. i will have to work on that later. </p>
      <p>But like my friend and others said, cant just hole myself up in a room and work on my stuff. i will start to get back to my old routine which is gymming and welcome my brother to this place as well because he is coming to visit me. in the meantime, i will go to a park, immerse myself with nature and appreciate life as much as possible i guess.</p>

      <p>Things I did today:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set up the blog</li>
        <li>Play some bass (its actually fun to do music!)</li>
        <li>Game (have to add this because i lose my passion for this, have to get back to it)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Cheers for years and good day to y'all reading this!</p>
