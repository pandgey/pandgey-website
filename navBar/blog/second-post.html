    <h1>Exam just finished, and oh boy</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 17, 2025</p>

      <p>My exam just finished and oh boy, as usual i didnt complete it and now im feeling kinda crap right now like real bad.</p>
      <p>But you know what? Exam is finished. now i can focus on this website, my other side projects and game and more and so on. i can keep talking and yap as much as possible but nah, imma keep it short and simple. i will continue to work on my project. specifically, improving this website to the best it can be which i know there is no way since my javascript is very scrappy. i will have to work on that later. </p>
      <p>But like my friend and others said, cant just hole myself up in a room and work on my stuff. i will have to start to get back to my old routine which is gymming. in the meantime, i will go to a park, immerse myself with nature and appreciate life as much as possible i guess.</p>

      <p>Things I did today:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Set up a blog</li>
        <li>Play some bass (its actually fun to do music!)</li>
        <li>Game (have to add this because i lose my passion for this, have to get back to it)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Cheers for years and good day to y'all reading this!</p>
