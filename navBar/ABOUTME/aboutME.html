            <p style = "font-size: 25px">i play a lot of games, but these are the ones that i really like and play a lot. Lets start with singleplayer games. These games are cyberpunk 2077, rdr2, titanfall2, skyrim, final fantasy, celeste, and minecraft. right now, i want to play more indie games because i want to support the indie devs. i realized that their game is actually really good but does not recieved that recognition.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p style = "font-size: 25px">personally, i like to listen to game, anime or movie soundtracks or sometimes weird sound. its just really good idk why. i always listen to all the weird music, just because i always want to hear new sounds. i would say im getting into underground and lofi now? idk, they just produce some of the good stuff but does not recieved that much recognition. idk, maybe thats just me. :P</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p style = "font-size: 25px">this one is a hard one. i watch lots and lots of anime and movies and tv shows. so far, i like the sandman series, spiderverse, akira, gundam and cyberpunk anime series. i mostly love that futuristic and cyberpunk concept. henry danger and impractical jokers are also fun! i like it because its somewhat weird and funny. for sandman, i like it because i love the concept of dream and death. weird, ik. i think there are more but these are just a few of them.</p>
